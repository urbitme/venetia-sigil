# Venetia-Sigil

[Venetia](https://github.com/tylershuster/venetia) is a simple command-line utility for generating a list of planet names issuable from an Urbit star.  This project expands on the original Venetia to allow searching for planets by sigil shape.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the directory.

## Running

In the directory run `node index.js` and follow the prompts.

There is a variety of general and star specific information to browse through.  If you are a star owner you probably want the following:

```
> Star Actions
> Enter star name
> Planets with interesting sigils
```

A directory named after your star will be created, and lists of planets will be generated inside.
